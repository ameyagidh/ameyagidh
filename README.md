<h1 align="center"> Hi there, I'm Ameya Santosh Gidh 👋 </h1>

I'm passionate about __Machine Learning__ and __Data Science__. With the development of technology, I believe that there is a huge potential for Artificial Intelligence in different domains. The rapid rate at which there is advancement in computing power and the freedom to take a large amount of data pushes the field of Data Science and Machine Learning to a whole new level.

<h2> 👨‍🎓🙋‍♂️ About Me 💼🎒: </h2>

I hold a Masters Degree in Computer Science from [__Northeastern University - Khoury College of Computer Sciences__](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). With over *2+ years* of experience, I've been actively involved in building and deploying machine learning and deep learning models. I've also successfully completed the Machine Learning Certification from [__Stanford University__](https://www.stanford.edu/) and the Deep Learning Specialization by [__Andrew Ng__](https://www.andrewng.org/).

My journey led me to work on diverse projects in industries like pharmaceutical, agricultural, retail, manufacturing, and automobile sectors. During this time, I've gained valuable experience from companies such as [__Delsys__], [__Adagrad AI__], [ ABP Systems and Solutions], and [__Khoury College of Computer Sciences__](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/).

<h2>🪚🔧 My Skills 😀😀:</h2>

Starting from my early days, I acquired coding skills through __C__ language. My continuous learning led me to Python, which significantly expanded my grasp of machine learning and data science. I've developed strong coding principles and proficiency in languages like __R__. These skills form the foundation of my journey towards becoming a successful __machine learning engineer__ and __data scientist__.
